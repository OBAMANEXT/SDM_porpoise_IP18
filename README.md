## SDM analyses for harbour porpoises in the Inner Danish Waters

Author: Floris M. van Beest (flbe[at]ecos.au.dk)

Why: The below code was generated during the OBAMA-NEXT project to fulfil IP 18.

Reference: The code follows the MaxEnt procedure described in the article: van Beest FM, Carstensen J, Dietz R, Nabe-Nielsen J, Sveegaard S, Teilmann J (2025) Shifts in habitat suitability for harbour porpoises leads to reduced importance of marine protected areas. Biological Conservation 302:111009 [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2025.111009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2025.111009)

Brief overview of code and data: The code reads the harbour porpoise tracking data (based on ARGOS tags), cleans the Argos data, and performs a MaxEnt analyses to generate habitat suitability layers for one season and period (out of 6). Raster data is based on Copernicus data, which is freely available but also provided in the raster folder. To generate habitat suitability layers for all season and periods described in the article, adjust the code to the season and period of interest and rerun the procedure.
